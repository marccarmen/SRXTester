SRXTester
=========
This is a simple GUI that is built to demonstrate the SRX library included in Okapi ( http://www.opentag.com/okapi/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page )  In the GUI you can select a file with the segementation rules, an input file, and where to store the output files.

The following jars are included from Okapi
* checkmate.jar
* rainbow.jar
* ratel.jar
* tikal.jar

In the data directory are three files.  
* DefaultRules.srx is a segmentation file from the Okapi project
* ep-00-01-17.en is a sample text file from the EuroParl corpus 
* ep-00-01-17.en.out is the output file using this DefaultRules.srx and ep-00-01-17.en files
